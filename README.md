# Data-Analysis-Projects
These are projects that i did to showcase my Data Analysis skills using various technologies such as Microsoft Excel, SQL, PowerBI, Tableau, R and Python.
I have cleaned data using Microsoft Excel PowerQuery (which is an Extract, Transform and Load (ETL)), used Microsoft PowerPivot to model my data as well as use DAX language. I used PivotTables as well as PivotCharts to summerize and visualize the data for reporting. I have created Interactive Dashboards to demonstrate metrics as well as important KPIs.
